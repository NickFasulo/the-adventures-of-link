### Introduction

""

That is the beginning of our story. How will it end? It's UP TO YOU.

What we'll be making today is a Choose Your Own Adventure story. In HTML. With links.


### Content

How the story progresses from that initial page is totally up to you, as is its length. There are no stretch goals here, per se: just keep making pages that expand your story!
